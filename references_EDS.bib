  abstract = {A serious limitation in the use of energy dispersive spectrometers (EDS) for materials characterization arises from the fact that these x-ray detectors provide a poor energy resolution compared to other x-ray techniques. This is mainly due to the broadening function generated by the electronics of the detector. However, new windowless detectors are now capable of resolving low energy peaks like Li Kα with modified electronics and show a system peak full width at half maximum (FWHM) of around 30 eV. In this paper, we investigated how the Richardson-Lucy algorithm can be used to remove, or at least attenuate, the contribution of the broadening function to experimental spectra. This method proved to be efficient in improving the energy resolution at any energy in the EDS spectrum. The resulting system peak FWHM was reduced to as low as 7–8 eV and the separation of low energy x-ray peaks were demonstrated in the low energy range of the spectra. The method was also efficient in reducing the peak broadening at higher energies (Cu Kα) and the broadening function of the detector could be experimentally determined to provide higher accuracy in predicting peak broadening. Although some critical artefacts were noted on the restored spectra, like energy shifts and intensity variations, the method explored in this work is worth to be considered for further quantification tests.}

The combination of a thin specimen and the extreme stability of the energy dispersive X-ray detector enables the experimental determination of a calibration curve of X-ray production—detection efficiency vs characteristic X-ray energy. Quantitative analysis can be carried out using the calibration curve without reference to standards at the time of analysis.},
