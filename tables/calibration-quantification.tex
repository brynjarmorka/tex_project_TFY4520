    \caption{
        Quantification with different calibration methods.
        The quantification is done by in HyperSpy with Cliff-Lorimer method.
        The CL method is for this samples, while the GaAs wafer used here is a bulk sample.
        AZ is the AZtec calibration.
        HS is the HyperSpy calibration.
        GaAs is the calibration on the GaAs 30 kV spectrum.
        The accuracy of the quantification is the deviation from 50\%, because the sampled area is 1:1 GaAs wafer.
