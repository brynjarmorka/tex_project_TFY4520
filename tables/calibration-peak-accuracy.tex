    \caption{
        Peak accuracy of the different calibration methods on 30 kV spectra.
        The other acceleration voltages gave similar results.
        The accuracy here is the deviation from the theoretical peak to the measured peak, given in percent.
        The measured peak is the fitted center of the peak.
        % discussion: The Mo L$\alpha$ deviates much because the peak is not well fitted.
        The C K$\alpha$ is fitted well, but deviates much more than all the other peaks.
        The self-made calibration was done on two spectra: GaAs and Mo. % discussion: Mo is more far apart than GaAs.
        % One was done on Ga L$_\alpha$ and As K$_\alpha$ from the 30 kV measurement on the GaAs wafer.
        % The other was done on the more far apart peaks Mo L$_\alpha$ and Mo K$_\alpha$ from the 30 kV measurement on the Mo wafer.
        The HyperSpy calibration was done on the GaAs spectrum.
