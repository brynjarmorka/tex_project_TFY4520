    \caption{
        Peak accuracy of the different calibration methods.
        The accuracy here is the deviation from the theoretical peak to the measured peak.
        The measured peak is the Gaussian fitted center of the peak.
        All results are from the 30 kV measurements.
        The own calibration was done on Ga L$_\alpha$ and As K$_\alpha$ from the 30 kV measurement on the GaAs wafer.
        The HyperSpy cailbration was done by making a model and fitting it to the data on the 30 kV GaAs spectrum.
        AZ is short for AZtec.
        HS is short for HyperSpy.
        All deviations are in percentage difference from the theoretical peak value.
