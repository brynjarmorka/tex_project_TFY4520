    \caption{
        Different calibration values.
        The AZtec calibration is reffered to as the uncalibrated value.
        The dispersion is calculated with \cref{eq:theory:calibration:dispersion}.
        The offset is calculated with \cref{eq:theory:calibration:offset}.
        The own calibration was done on Ga L$_\alpha$ and As K$_\alpha$ from the 30 kV measurement on the GaAs wafer.
        The HyperSpy cailbration was done by making a model and fitting it to the data on the 30 kV GaAs spectrum.
