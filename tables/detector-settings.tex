        Table giving the detector settings for the different spectra.
        The other detector settings are the same for all the measurements, and they were the following.
        Working distance was 10 mm.
        Range was 0 to 20 keV, with 2048 channels.
        Processing time was set to 5 and each spectrum was collected with 2 minutes time live.
        Since the dead time on the GaAs bulk sample were high, the sampling was manually cut short.
