\chapter{HyperSpy quantification}
\label{appendix:HSquant}

The following notebook is quantification in HyperSpy.
The notebook does three quantifications: linear background removal and intensities from the raw spectrum, intensities from a fitted model, and intensities from a model fitted with calibration in HyperSpy.
