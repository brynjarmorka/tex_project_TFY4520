\chapter*{Preface and acknowledgements}


This is my specialization project done in the 9th semester of the master's program in Nanotechnology at NTNU.
During my studies I have tried to focus on the development of my skills in programming, and this project is a continuation of that.
I appreciate the opportunity to combine programming and nanotechnology in this project, and I look forward to continuing the work in my master's thesis.

For guidance and support during the project, I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor \textit{Antonius T. J. van Helvoort}, at the TEM Gemini Center, Department of Physics at NTNU.
His enthusiasm has been an inspiration, and our weekly meeting have been a great success.

The SEM EDS data used in this project is from NTNU NanoLab.
Thanks to the Norwegian Research Council for funding the NorFab and NanoLab, and to the NanoLab staff for providing an excellent working environment and for their help with the data acquisition.


I am grateful to my teachers at Forskerlinja at Vestby videregående skole, who inspired me to study nanotechnology and taught me how to write scientific reports.
I am even more grateful to Timini and Kull18, my time at Nanotechnology would probably have been shorter without you.
I want to thank my family for the support and holidays home in Hvitsten.
The COVID-time would have sucked way more if I had not been busy as the leader of Timini, joined Organisasjonskollegiet, and taken the year of telemark skiing and climbing in Innsbruck.
I want to thank my friends for all the fun we have had, the good food we have made and the adventures we have shared.

Last but not least, I wanna thank me.
