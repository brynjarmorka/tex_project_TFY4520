\chapter{Results}

% Qualitative first, as is the way in EDS.
% 	- spectrum calibrated, 5-30 kV
% 	- one plot for all
% 	- Look at energy scale for all results. How does the peaks deviate with the Ga As calibration?
% 	- Cu tape (give type) is not good as a Cu reference.
% 	- The stub is not Fe as expected, but Al. Makes sence, since steel is alloys and is magnetic.

% Quantitative
% 	- initial
% 	- background
% 	- peak fitting


\section{Introduction}

The results are presented in this chapter.
First qualitative then quantitative results are presented.

\section{Quantitative results}

\subsection{Initial quantification}
\label{sec:results:initial_quantification}
% How accurate it the out-of-the-box quantification in AZtec and HyperSpy?

The initial quantification was done on the data from the GaAs wafer in AZtec and in HyperSpy as out-of-the-box as possible.
The results are presented in \cref{tab:initial_quantification}.
The wafer is a 1:1 alloy of gallium and arsenic, so the atomic percent of Ga and As should be 50\% and 50\% respectively.
