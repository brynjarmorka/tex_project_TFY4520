% Qualitative first, as is the way in EDS.
% 	- spectrum calibrated, 5-30 kV
% 	- one plot for all
% 	- Look at energy scale for all results. How does the peaks deviate with the Ga As calibration?
% 	- Cu tape (give type) is not good as a Cu reference.
% 	- The stub is not Fe as expected, but Al. Makes sence, since steel is alloys and is magnetic.

% Quantitative
% 	- initial
% 	- background
% 	- peak fitting


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:results:intro}
The results are presented in this chapter.
First qualitative then quantitative results are presented.
All the spectra taken were qualitatively analyzed.
The spectrum from the GaAs bulk wafer taken on 30 kV is shown in \cref{fig:GaAs30kV_HS}.
This plot was made with HyperSpy, which utilize Matplotlib for plotting.
The plotting method in HyperSpy can add where the theoretical peak centers are.
The lines added also show an estimate of the weight of the peak.

        This plot was made with HyperSpy, which use Matplotlib.
        The theoretical peak centers are added as lines.
        (a) is the whole spectrum.
        (b) is the zoomed in on the L-peaks.
        (c) is zoomed in on the K-peaks.
        (d) is zoomed in on the Ga K$\alpha$ peak.
        This plot has the calibration from AZtec, and it is clear that the line position is deviating from the center of the peaks.

\section{Qualitative results}
\label{sec:results:qualitative}

\cref{fig:results:Spectra_Al} to \cref{fig:results:Spectra_Si} shows the spectra for the six different areas of the sample plotted with PLotly.
The plots are available as an interactive HTML plots on the GitHub repository.
\brynjar{Upload the HTML files to the GitHub repository.}
The calibration used in these spectra is based on the calibration of Ga L$\alpha$ and As K$\alpha$ from the GaAs bulk wafer.
The y-axis is normalized to the highest peak value in each spectrum.
When doing the qualitative analysis, it became clear that the FIB stub was not made of Fe as expected, but rather of Al.
Another discovery was that the Cu-tape does not give a good Cu signal.

\subsection{Calibration}
\label{sec:results:qualitative:calibration}

Different calibrations were explored.
The initial calibration is the one from AZtec, and is the one used in the spectra in \cref{fig:GaAs30kV_HS}.
This calibration has a left shift for the L-peaks and a right shift for the K-peaks.
The second type of calibration is the one given by the model fit in HyperSpy.
The third type is from the self made model fit, using the distance between two high intensity and far apart peaks to calibrate the energy scale.
Values for the three calibrations are given in Table \ref{tab:results:calibrations}.
The deviations are a few percent, and the accuracy of the different calibrations give on spesific peaks are given in \cref{tab:results:calibration-peak-accuracy}.
Here accuracy is the difference between the theoretical peak position and the peak center in the spectrum, given in percent.

\section{Quantitative results}
\label{sec:results:quantification}


\subsection{Initial quantification}
\label{sec:results:initial_quantification}
% How accurate it the out-of-the-box quantification in AZtec and HyperSpy?

The initial quantification was done on the data from the GaAs wafer in AZtec and in HyperSpy as out-of-the-box as possible.
The results are presented in \cref{tab:initial_quantification}.
The wafer is a 1:1 alloy of gallium and arsenic, so the atomic percent of Ga and As should be 50\% and 50\% respectively.
