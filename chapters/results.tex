\chapter{Results}


\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:results:intro}
The results are presented in this chapter.
The sections follow the structure of the sub-problems in \cref{chap:introduction}.

\section{Initial quantification}
\label{sec:results:initial_quantification}
The initial quantification was done on GaAs in AZtec and in HyperSpy as out-of-the-box as possible. The results are presented in \cref{tab:initial_quantification}.

\section{Steps in the analysis}
\label{sec:results:steps}
The first sub-problem was to find out what is done with the data at the different steps in the analysis.
\ton{Is this interesting to write about?}


\section{Calibration}
\label{sec:results:calibration}
The calibration of the

% Something about how the calibrated peak of Ga $K\alpha$ is directly on $K\alpha_1$.


\section{Peak and background modelling}
\label{sec:results:modelling}
The third sub-problem was to find out how the peaks and the background are modelled in a way that is easy to understand.


\section{Background models}
\label{sec:results:background}
The fourth sub-problem was to find out how different background models affect the quantitative analysis done in HyperSpy.


\section{Failure}
\label{sec:results:failure}
The fifth sub-problem was to find out when the analysis fails, both in AZtec and HyperSpy.
