The results are presented in this chapter.
First qualitative then quantitative results are presented.

\section{Quantitative results}
\label{sec:results:quantification}


\subsection{Initial quantification}
\label{sec:results:initial_quantification}
% How accurate it the out-of-the-box quantification in AZtec and HyperSpy?

The initial quantification was done on the data from the GaAs wafer in AZtec and in HyperSpy as out-of-the-box as possible.
The results are presented in \cref{tab:initial_quantification}.
The wafer is a 1:1 alloy of gallium and arsenic, so the atomic percent of Ga and As should be 50\% and 50\% respectively.
