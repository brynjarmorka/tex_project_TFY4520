\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}


The conclusion chapter covers the main finding, the limitations of the work done in this project and the future work.

\section{Main findings}
\label{sec:mainfindings}

The main findings of this project are:

% CL TEM is not reliable for SEM
% Sometimes is breaks down

% modelling spectra to get peak intensities give better area counts than just using a window. ref figure of the model fit and overlapping peaks.

% Calibration
% deviations are small. Se fig Ga-K and the table wit p accuracy
% conclusion: recalibrate would be nice, but not critical



\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}

The limitations of this project are:

% SEM data analyzed as TEM data
% time and new materials
% understanding open source code is hard, because thay have corner cases to handle



\section{Future work}
\label{sec:futurework}

Ideas for future work based on the findings of this project are separated into three categories: improvments for the current code developed, implementations for HyperSpy and general ideas for future work in EDS analysis.


% Improve the current code



% Implementations for HyperSpy



% General ideas for future work in EDS analysis
